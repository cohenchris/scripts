# Generic Bin

Dependency-free system scripts which are intended to be added to PATH and run from the command line.

These focus on generic everyday automations.
Think of these as scripts that can be easily moved from system to system with zero effort (assuming the correct packages are installed).
For example, one of the scripts in here is a file extraction wrapper which uses different programs depending on the file extension - this can be dropped on any system that supports bash.

## Require Var, File, or Dir
[`require [TYPE] [THING]`](require)

Check for the existence of something.

if TYPE == "var"    - interpret *THING* as a variable, check that the variable is not empty
if TYPE == "file"   - interpret *THING* as a file path, check that the file exists
if TYPE == "dir"    - interpret *THING* as a directory path, check that the directory exists




## Send Email
[`send-email [ADDRESS] [SUBJECT] [ATTACHMENT?]`](send-email)

Handy wrapper to send emails from the terminal.
The body of the email is read from stdin. For example:

`echo "This is the body of an email" | send-email "test@example.com" "Email SUBJECT" /path/to/attachment`




## System Update
[`update`](update)

This script is meant to run on a system running the `paru` AUR helper package manager (likely Arch Linux).
It also assumes that the user has a docker-compose stack located at `/home/${USER}/server.

1. Synchronize, install, and upgrade all packages
2. Clean the package cache to remove unused packages
3. Update all docker-compose images
4. Remove all dangling docker container images
5. Mirror EFI boot partitions on mirrored ZFS root pool


## WiFi Selection Menu
[`wifi-menu`](wifi-menu)

Fuzzel-based wifi network selection menu.
Utilizes `nmcli` to scan for available networks and presents them in a friendly list.
The user may then navigate this list using arrow keys or vim directional bindings (h/j/k/l) and select the desired network by pressing Enter.




## Archive Extraction
[`extract [FILE...]`](extract)

There are many different types of compressed files, each of which requires a different extraction program.
This script allows an unlimited number of arguments to be passed, each of which should be some sort of compressed file.
It will loop through each argument and use the correct extraction program based on the file extension.




## Local E-Mail Sync
[`mailsync`](mailsync)

1. Sync all emails using `mbsync`
2. Index synced emails using `notmuch`
3. Notify the user about any new unread emails
4. Sync contacts using `vdirsyncer`

Synced email may be viewed with a local client such as `neomutt`.




## LF File Manager Wrapper
[`lf-wrapper`](lf-wrapper)

A wrapper script for lf which:
    - Ensures that the lf cache directory is created
    - Provides functionality to `cd` to the last working directory
        - For this to work, this wrapper must be sourced instead of called directly

This script is based on the lfcd script provided in the official lf repository [here](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/blob/master/etc/lfcd.sh).




## LaTeX Shortcuts
[`my-tex [compile,create,edit] [FILENAME]`](my-tex)

This script helps automate common LaTeX commands that I use.
The user will pass a filename as an argument.

Behavior differs depending on the subcommand:

`compile <tex_source_file>` compiles the source file into a PDF.

`create <filename>` spits out a file (name provided as an argument) which contains a very simple LaTeX template.

`edit <tex_source_file>` compiles the source file into a PDF, open the PDF, and open the source file in vim.




## Music Video Downloader
[`mvdl [FILE]`](mvdl)

This script reads in a file which contains newline-separated YouTube music video URLs.
If there is a music file and music video file with the same name, Plex can automatically detect this and associate the two files.
If there is a music file with an associated music video file, Plex will allow you to play either file.
This script is an attempt to automate the process of pulling + renaming music videos for this feature.
You may read about this naming process [here](https://support.plex.tv/articles/205568377-adding-local-artist-and-music-videos/).

This script is pretty hardcoded to my personal environment and directory structure.

1. User points the script to music and music video directories
2. Download each video
3. Based on the title of the music video, attempt to find a matching music file
4. If a match is found, rename the downloaded music video according to the standard linked above
5. If a match is not found, rename the downloaded music video to a cleaner, more readable version




## Set Wallpaper
[`set-wallpaper [random, <filepath>]`](set-wallpaper)

Sets the user's wallpaper.

`set-wallpaper random` selects and random image from the `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/wallpapers` directory and sets it as the user's wallpaper.
`set-wallpaper <filepath>` sets the user's wallpaper to the image at `<filepath>`.




## Email Lookup
[`email-lookup [query]`](email-lookup)

Searches for an email address matching 'query' in your local khard address book.
This is intended to be used for autocompletion by another program, like neomutt.




## Custom Pinentry
[`my-pinentry`](my-pinentry)

Custom pinentry program.
If executed within a graphical environment, this script will run my custom fuzzel-based pinentry implementation.
Otherwise, the script will fall back to the system default `pinentry` program.`
I often use this to unlock my GPG keyring.

To configure this program as pinentry for unlocking your GPG keyring, the following line should be in your `gpg-agent.conf` file:

```sh
pinentry-program /path/to/my-pinentry
```




## Notification Wrapper
[`notify [GOOD,NORMAL,CRITICAL] [message1] [message2]`](notify)

Easy-to-use notify-send wrapper for sending desktop notifications.
Used by many of the scripts in this repository.




## Screenshot Wrapper
[`screenshot`](screenshot)

Screenshot utility wrapper script that vastly improves quality-of-life.
Notifies the user about what is happening, status of the screenshot, and where it is saved.
It will also open up a file manager at the location where the screenshot is saved.




## VPN Selection Menu
[`vpn-menu`](vpn-menu)

Fuzzel-based Wireguard VPN server selection menu.
Relies on config files present in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/wireguard` to scan for configured VPN server endpoints and presents them in a selectable list.
The user may then navigate this list using arrow keys or vim directional bindings (h/j/k/l) and select the desired VPN server by pressing Enter.




## Fuzzel Askpass
[`fuzzel-askpass`](fuzzel-askpass)

Fuzzel-based askpass entry program.
Intended to be used with sudo as a graphical password prompt.

```sh
export SUDO_ASKPASS="/path/to/fuzzel-askpass"
sudo -A <command>
```




## Unicode Character Selection Menu
[`unicode-char-menu`](unicode-char-menu)

Fuzzel-based selection menu for unicode characters which would otherwise be impossible to type.
This script relies on files in the `${XDG_DATA_HOME}/chars`.
Each file that resides in this directory should be in one of the following formats:

```sh
<character> <description>
üìÅ file folder
üìÇ open file folder
üóÇÔ∏è card index dividers
```

OR

```sh
<character> <description>; <unicode_hex_identifier>
Ôäπ  address-book; f2b9
Ôäª  address-card; f2bb
ÔÅÇ  adjust; f042
```




## Hyprlock Reload
[`hyprlock-reload`](hyprlock-reload)

Sometimes, when the screen is locked, hyprlock crashes and the user can no longer login.
To remedy this, the user must login to a different TTY reload the program (run this script), and switch back to the original TTY to login.
This script is meant to be run after the user switches to a different TTY.




## Backblaze Bucket Quick Mount + Unmount via RClone
[`mount-b2 [mount, unmount]`](mount-b2)

I store all of my remote backups (the "1" in 3-2-1 backups) in a Backblaze B2 buckets.
Sometimes, it's useful to navigate this bucket manually to check out its contents.
RClone is a fantastic tool that allows mounting of a Backblaze B2 bucket to your local machine, and this script streamlines the rclone mount/unmount process.

This scripts assumes that:
- `rclone` is installed on your machine
- There is an rclone remote configured which is named `backblaze`

### Use
`mount-b2 mount <bucketname> <dirname>`

Mounts the Backblaze bucket with name <bucketname> to the directory specified by <dirname>.

`mount-b2 unmount <dirname>`

Unmounts the mounted Backblaze bucket at the location specified by <dirname>.
